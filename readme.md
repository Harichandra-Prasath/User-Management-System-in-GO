# User Management System with JWT Token Authentication

This project is a User Management System built using Fiber as the web framework. It incorporates JWT token authentication for securing routes, and utilizes PostgreSQL as the database with Gorm as the ORM. Bcrypt is employed for password hashing, and Validators ensure the integrity of post submissions. The system includes four main routes: Dashboard, Login, Logout, and Signup.
